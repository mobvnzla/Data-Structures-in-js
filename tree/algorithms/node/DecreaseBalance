Decrease Balance(dir)
this revursive operation has 2 base cases:
case 1) when the balance is smaller than -1 or bigger than 1
case 2) when balance is -1 or 1 after being decreased

1) check dir in order to decrese balance of the node
    dir == right -> balance-- -> go step *
    dir == left -> balance++ -> go step *

*) is balance == -1 or balance ==1?
    Yes -> exit program !!
    No -> go step 2

2) check node's balance after decrease
is balance smaller than -1 or bigger than 1?
    Yes -> trigger balance method -> exit program !!
    No -> go step 3

3) compare node with it's parent
    parent < node -> NewDir = right -> go step 4
    parent > node -> NewDir = left -> go step 4

4) tell to its parent to decrese it's balance by: parent.DecreaseBalance(NewDir)
