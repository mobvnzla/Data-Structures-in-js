Every node has:

attributes:

1. value
2. parent: a reference to its parent node. (the root node is it's own parent)
3. balance: a parameter to know if the node is balanced
4. right: the place where another node with higher value will go
5. left: the place where another node with lower value will go

methods:

1. setChild: this sets a new node in a certain direction, either left or right
2. Increase balance: este método ayuda a rastrear el equilibrio del árbol
3. Decrease balance: same purpose as increase balance method
