search(number, parent = root)

1) compare number with parent
    number == parent:true -> parent -> end program !!
    number < parent -> go step 2
    number > parent -> go step 2

2) parent has child in that direction?
    No -> number doesnt exits -> end program !!
    Yes -> invoke search(number, child)
