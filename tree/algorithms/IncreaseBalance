IncreaseBalance (dir)

1) check dir in order to Increase Balance of the node
    dir == right -> balance++ -> step 2
    dir == left -> balance-- -> step 2

2) check node's balance after increase
is balance smaller than -1 or bigger than 1?
    Yes -> trigger balance method -> exit program !!
    No -> go step 3


3) compare node with it's parent
    parent  < this -> NewDir = right -> step 4
    parent > this -> NewDir = left -> step 4

4) tell to it's parent to increase it's balance by: parent.IncreaseBalance(NewDir)
