# Introduction to Graphs

## what's a Graph?

> Graph is a collection of nodes and edges in which nodes are connected with edges

Generally, a graph G is represented as G = ( V , E ), where V is set of vertices and E is set of edges.

## Graph Terminology

Vertex
: Individual data element of a graph is called as Vertex. Vertex is also known as node.

Edge
: An edge is a connecting link between two vertices. Edge is also known as Arc. An edge is represented as (startingVertex, endingVertex).

Undirected Edge - An undirected egde is a bidirectional edge. If there is undirected edge between vertices A and B then edge (A , B) is equal to edge (B , A).

Directed Edge - A directed egde is a unidirectional edge. If there is directed edge between vertices A and B then edge (A , B) is not equal to edge (B , A).

Weighted Edge - A weighted egde is a edge with value (cost) on it.

Undirected Graph
: A graph with only undirected edges is said to be undirected graph.

Origin
: If a edge is directed, its first endpoint is said to be the origin of it.

Destination
: If a edge is directed, its first endpoint is said to be the origin of it and the other endpoint is said to be the destination of that edge.

Adjacent
: If there is an edge between vertices A and B then both A and B are said to be adjacent. In other words, vertices A and B are said to be adjacent if there is an edge between them.

Degree
: Total number of edges connected to a vertex is said to be degree of that vertex.

Path
: A path is a sequence of alternate vertices and edges that starts at a vertex and ends at other vertex such that each edge is incident to its predecessor and successor vertex.
